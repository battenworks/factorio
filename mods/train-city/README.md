# train-city

My first Factorio mod. I've built out an automated train city, and I'd like to capture that concept in a mod.

Inspiration from this thread: https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=80&t=53473

What could it do?
- ~~Train type that transports players around the city.~~ done
- Trains that are associated with items, to automatically set schedules/routes.
- On a change event of item 'drop the items you currently have, and then go load the new items and remain on the new schedule'.
- UI that allows us to see metrics/state of item trains and add/remove trains from that item route.
- Allow an item type to be selectable while editing individual trains.
