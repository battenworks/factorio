# train-city

My first Factorio mod. I've built out an automated train city, and I'd like to capture that concept in a mod.

Inspiration from this thread: https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=80&t=53473

What could it do?
- [x] Train type that transports players around the city.
- [ ] Trains that are associated with items, to automatically set schedules/routes.
- [ ] On a change event of item 'deliver the items you currently have, and then go load the new items and remain on the new schedule'.
- [ ] UI that allows us to see metrics/state of item trains and add/remove trains from that item route.
- [ ] Allow an item type to be selectable while editing individual trains.
- [ ] Make trains smart enough to stop for fuel only when they need to.
- [ ] Make fuel stations configurable from one place.
- [ ] Make ammo stations configurable from one place.
